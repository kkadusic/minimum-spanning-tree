# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

This repository contains Python implementation of Prim's algorithm for solving the minimum spanning tree problem as well as an IEEE paper on the same topic.
In this paper, the problem of the minimum spanning tree is discussed with an explanation of the basic concepts of graph theory that are relevant to this problem. The methods and currently used algorithms were presented with a detailed analysis of the Prim algorithm, which was necessary for its successful implementation in the Python programming language. The implemented algorithm is then applied to real-life practical problems, which enabled further analysis of the minimum spanning tree principles with a visual representation of each algorithm iteration. At the very end, the performance of the algorithm was tested, as well as a way for its optimization.
